Troubleshooting
----

If your panda will not flash and green LED is on, use `recover.py`.
If panda is blinking fast with green LED, use `flash.py`.

Otherwise if LED is off and panda can't be seen with `lsusb` command, use [panda paw](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda-paw) to go into DFU mode.

If your device has an internal panda and none of the above works, try running `../scripts/reflash_internal_panda.py`.
