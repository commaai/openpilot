Description: Flask
        =====
        
        Flask is a lightweight `WSGI`_ web application framework. It is designed
        to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to
        complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around `Werkzeug`_
        and `Jinja`_ and has become one of the most popular Python web
        application frameworks.
        
        Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or
        project layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and
        libraries they want to use. There are many extensions provided by the
        community that make adding new functionality easy.
