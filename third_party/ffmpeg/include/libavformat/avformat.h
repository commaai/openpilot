/**
 * @defgroup libavf libavformat
 * I/O and Muxing/Demuxing Library
 *
 * Libavformat (lavf) is a library for dealing with various media container
 * formats. Its main two purposes are demuxing - i.e. splitting a media file
 * into component streams, and the reverse process of muxing - writing supplied
 * data in a specified container format. It also has an @ref lavf_io
 * "I/O module" which supports a number of protocols for accessing the data (e.g.
 * file, tcp, http and others).
 * Unless you are absolutely sure you won't use libavformat's network
 * capabilities, you should also call avformat_network_init().
 *
 * A supported input format is described by an AVInputFormat struct, conversely
 * an output format is described by AVOutputFormat. You can iterate over all
 * input/output formats using the  av_demuxer_iterate / av_muxer_iterate() functions.
 * The protocols layer is not part of the public API, so you can only get the names
 * of supported protocols with the avio_enum_protocols() function.
 *
 * Main lavf structure used for both muxing and demuxing is AVFormatContext,
 * which exports all information about the file being read or written. As with
 * most Libavformat structures, its size is not part of public ABI, so it cannot be
 * allocated on stack or directly with av_malloc(). To create an
 * AVFormatContext, use avformat_alloc_context() (some functions, like
 * avformat_open_input() might do that for you).
 *
 * Most importantly an AVFormatContext contains:
 * @li the @ref AVFormatContext.iformat "input" or @ref AVFormatContext.oformat
 * "output" format. It is either autodetected or set by user for input;
 * always set by user for output.
 * @li an @ref AVFormatContext.streams "array" of AVStreams, which describe all
 * elementary streams stored in the file. AVStreams are typically referred to
 * using their index in this array.
 * @li an @ref AVFormatContext.pb "I/O context". It is either opened by lavf or
 * set by user for input, always set by user for output (unless you are dealing
 * with an AVFMT_NOFILE format).
 *
 * @section lavf_options Passing options to (de)muxers
 * It is possible to configure lavf muxers and demuxers using the @ref avoptions
 * mechanism. Generic (format-independent) libavformat options are provided by
 * AVFormatContext, they can be examined from a user program by calling
 * av_opt_next() / av_opt_find() on an allocated AVFormatContext (or its AVClass
 * from avformat_get_class()). Private (format-specific) options are provided by
 * AVFormatContext.priv_data if and only if AVInputFormat.priv_class /
 * AVOutputFormat.priv_class of the corresponding format struct is non-NULL.
 * Further options may be provided by the @ref AVFormatContext.pb "I/O context",
 * if its AVClass is non-NULL, and the protocols layer. See the discussion on
 * nesting in @ref avoptions documentation to learn how to access those.
 *
 * @section urls
 * URL strings in libavformat are made of a scheme/protocol, a ':', and a
 * scheme specific string. URLs without a scheme and ':' used for local files
 * are supported but deprecated. "file:" should be used for local files.
 *
 * It is important that the scheme string is not taken from untrusted
 * sources without checks.
 *
 * Note that some schemes/protocols are quite powerful, allowing access to
 * both local and remote files, parts of them, concatenations of them, local
 * audio and video devices and so on.
 *
 * @{
 *
 * @defgroup lavf_decoding Demuxing
 * @{
 * Demuxers read a media file and split it into chunks of data (@em packets). A
 * @ref AVPacket "packet" contains one or more encoded frames which belongs to a
 * single elementary stream. In the lavf API this process is represented by the
 * avformat_open_input() function for opening a file, av_read_frame() for
 * reading a single packet and finally avformat_close_input(), which does the
 * cleanup.
 *
 * @section lavf_decoding_open Opening a media file
 * The minimum information required to open a file is its URL, which
 * is passed to avformat_open_input(), as in the following code:
 * @code
 * const char    *url = "file:in.mp3";
 * AVFormatContext *s = NULL;
 * int ret = avformat_open_input(&s, url, NULL, NULL);
 * if (ret < 0)
 *     abort();
 * @endcode
 * The above code attempts to allocate an AVFormatContext, open the
 * specified file (autodetecting the format) and read the header, exporting the
 * information stored there into s. Some formats do not have a header or do not
 * store enough information there, so it is recommended that you call the
 * avformat_find_stream_info() function which tries to read and decode a few
 * frames to find missing information.
 *
 * In some cases you might want to preallocate an AVFormatContext yourself with
 * avformat_alloc_context() and do some tweaking on it before passing it to
 * avformat_open_input(). One such case is when you want to use custom functions
 * for reading input data instead of lavf internal I/O layer.
 * To do that, create your own AVIOContext with avio_alloc_context(), passing
 * your reading callbacks to it. Then set the @em pb field of your
 * AVFormatContext to newly created AVIOContext.
 *
 * Since the format of the opened file is in general not known until after
 * avformat_open_input() has returned, it is not possible to set demuxer private
 * options on a preallocated context. Instead, the options should be passed to
 * avformat_open_input() wrapped in an AVDictionary:
 * @code
 * AVDictionary *options = NULL;
 * av_dict_set(&options, "video_size", "640x480", 0);
 * av_dict_set(&options, "pixel_format", "rgb24", 0);
 *
 * if (avformat_open_input(&s, url, NULL, &options) < 0)
 *     abort();
 * av_dict_free(&options);
 * @endcode
 * This code passes the private options 'video_size' and 'pixel_format' to the
 * demuxer. They would be necessary for e.g. the rawvideo demuxer, since it
 * cannot know how to interpret raw video data otherwise. If the format turns
 * out to be something different than raw video, those options will not be
 * recognized by the demuxer and therefore will not be applied. Such unrecognized
 * options are then returned in the options dictionary (recognized options are
 * consumed). The calling program can handle such unrecognized options as it
 * wishes, e.g.
 * @code
 * AVDictionaryEntry *e;
 * if (e = av_dict_get(options, "", NULL, AV_DICT_IGNORE_SUFFIX)) {
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Option %s not recognized by the demuxer.\n", e->key);
 *     abort();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * After you have finished reading the file, you must close it with
 * avformat_close_input(). It will free everything associated with the file.
 *
 * @section lavf_decoding_read Reading from an opened file
 * Reading data from an opened AVFormatContext is done by repeatedly calling
 * av_read_frame() on it. Each call, if successful, will return an AVPacket
 * containing encoded data for one AVStream, identified by
 * AVPacket.stream_index. This packet may be passed straight into the libavcodec
 * decoding functions avcodec_send_packet() or avcodec_decode_subtitle2() if the
 * caller wishes to decode the data.
 *
 * AVPacket.pts, AVPacket.dts and AVPacket.duration timing information will be
 * set if known. They may also be unset (i.e. AV_NOPTS_VALUE for
 * pts/dts, 0 for duration) if the stream does not provide them. The timing
 * information will be in AVStream.time_base units, i.e. it has to be
 * multiplied by the timebase to convert them to seconds.
 *
 * A packet returned by av_read_frame() is always reference-counted,
 * i.e. AVPacket.buf is set and the user may keep it indefinitely.
 * The packet must be freed with av_packet_unref() when it is no
 * longer needed.
 *
 * @section lavf_decoding_seek Seeking
 * @}
 *
 * @defgroup lavf_encoding Muxing
 * @{
 * Muxers take encoded data in the form of @ref AVPacket "AVPackets" and write
 * it into files or other output bytestreams in the specified container format.
 *
 * The main API functions for muxing are avformat_write_header() for writing the
 * file header, av_write_frame() / av_interleaved_write_frame() for writing the
 * packets and av_write_trailer() for finalizing the file.
 *
 * At the beginning of the muxing process, the caller must first call
 * avformat_alloc_context() to create a muxing context. The caller then sets up
 * the muxer by filling the various fields in this context:
 *
 * - The @ref AVFormatContext.oformat "oformat" field must be set to select the
 *   muxer that will be used.
 * - Unless the format is of the AVFMT_NOFILE type, the @ref AVFormatContext.pb
 *   "pb" field must be set to an opened IO context, either returned from
 *   avio_open2() or a custom one.
 * - Unless the format is of the AVFMT_NOSTREAMS type, at least one stream must
 *   be created with the avformat_new_stream() function. The caller should fill
 *   the @ref AVStream.codecpar "stream codec parameters" information, such as the
 *   codec @ref AVCodecParameters.codec_type "type", @ref AVCodecParameters.codec_id
 *   "id" and other parameters (e.g. width / height, the pixel or sample format,
 *   etc.) as known. The @ref AVStream.time_base "stream timebase" should
 *   be set to the timebase that the caller desires to use for this stream (note
 *   that the timebase actually used by the muxer can be different, as will be
 *   described later).
 * - It is advised to manually initialize only the relevant fields in
 *   AVCodecParameters, rather than using @ref avcodec_parameters_copy() during
 *   remuxing: there is no guarantee that the codec context values remain valid
 *   for both input and output format contexts.
 * - The caller may fill in additional information, such as @ref
 *   AVFormatContext.metadata "global" or @ref AVStream.metadata "per-stream"
 *   metadata, @ref AVFormatContext.chapters "chapters", @ref
 *   AVFormatContext.programs "programs", etc. as described in the
 *   AVFormatContext documentation. Whether such information will actually be
 *   stored in the output depends on what the container format and the muxer
 *   support.
 *
 * When the muxing context is fully set up, the caller must call
 * avformat_write_header() to initialize the muxer internals and write the file
 * header. Whether anything actually is written to the IO context at this step
 * depends on the muxer, but this function must always be called. Any muxer
 * private options must be passed in the options parameter to this function.
 *
 * The data is then sent to the muxer by repeatedly calling av_write_frame() or
 * av_interleaved_write_frame() (consult those functions' documentation for
 * discussion on the difference between them; only one of them may be used with
 * a single muxing context, they should not be mixed). Do note that the timing
 * information on the packets sent to the muxer must be in the corresponding
 * AVStream's timebase. That timebase is set by the muxer (in the
 * avformat_write_header() step) and may be different from the timebase
 * requested by the caller.
 *
 * Once all the data has been written, the caller must call av_write_trailer()
 * to flush any buffered packets and finalize the output file, then close the IO
 * context (if any) and finally free the muxing context with
 * avformat_free_context().

 * @section lavf_io_dirlist Directory listing
 * The directory listing API makes it possible to list files on remote servers.
 *
 * Some of possible use cases:
 * - an "open file" dialog to choose files from a remote location,
 * - a recursive media finder providing a player with an ability to play all
 * files from a given directory.
 *
 * @subsection lavf_io_dirlist_open Opening a directory
 * At first, a directory needs to be opened by calling avio_open_dir()
 * supplied with a URL and, optionally, ::AVDictionary containing
 * protocol-specific parameters. The function returns zero or positive
 * integer and allocates AVIODirContext on success.
 *
 * @code
 * AVIODirContext *ctx = NULL;
 * if (avio_open_dir(&ctx, "smb://example.com/some_dir", NULL) < 0) {
 *     fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open directory.\n");
 *     abort();
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This code tries to open a sample directory using smb protocol without
 * any additional parameters.
 *
 * @subsection lavf_io_dirlist_read Reading entries
 * Each directory's entry (i.e. file, another directory, anything else
 * within ::AVIODirEntryType) is represented by AVIODirEntry.
 * Reading consecutive entries from an opened AVIODirContext is done by
 * repeatedly calling avio_read_dir() on it. Each call returns zero or
 * positive integer if successful. Reading can be stopped right after the
 * NULL entry has been read -- it means there are no entries left to be
 * read. The following code reads all entries from a directory associated
 * with ctx and prints their names to standard output.
 * @code
 * AVIODirEntry *entry = NULL;
 * for (;;) {
 *     if (avio_read_dir(ctx, &entry) < 0) {
 *         fprintf(stderr, "Cannot list directory.\n");
 *         abort();
 *     }

/**
 * @defgroup metadata_api Public Metadata API
 * @{
 * @ingroup libavf
 * The metadata API allows libavformat to export metadata tags to a client
 * application when demuxing. Conversely it allows a client application to
 * set metadata when muxing.
 *
 * Metadata is exported or set as pairs of key/value strings in the 'metadata'
 * fields of the AVFormatContext, AVStream, AVChapter and AVProgram structs
 * using the @ref lavu_dict "AVDictionary" API. Like all strings in FFmpeg,
 * metadata is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded Unicode. Note that metadata
 * exported by demuxers isn't checked to be valid UTF-8 in most cases.
 *
 * Important concepts to keep in mind:
 * -  Keys are unique; there can never be 2 tags with the same key. This is
 *    also meant semantically, i.e., a demuxer should not knowingly produce
 *    several keys that are literally different but semantically identical.
 *    E.g., key=Author5, key=Author6. In this example, all authors must be
 *    placed in the same tag.
 * -  Metadata is flat, not hierarchical; there are no subtags. If you
 *    want to store, e.g., the email address of the child of producer Alice
 *    and actor Bob, that could have key=alice_and_bobs_childs_email_address.
 * -  Several modifiers can be applied to the tag name. This is done by
 *    appending a dash character ('-') and the modifier name in the order
 *    they appear in the list below -- e.g. foo-eng-sort, not foo-sort-eng.
 *    -  language -- a tag whose value is localized for a particular language
 *       is appended with the ISO 639-2/B 3-letter language code.
 *       For example: Author-ger=Michael, Author-eng=Mike
 *       The original/default language is in the unqualified "Author" tag.
 *       A demuxer should set a default if it sets any translated tag.
 *    -  sorting  -- a modified version of a tag that should be used for
 *       sorting will have '-sort' appended. E.g. artist="The Beatles",
 *       artist-sort="Beatles, The".
 * - Some protocols and demuxers support metadata updates. After a successful
 *   call to av_read_frame(), AVFormatContext.event_flags or AVStream.event_flags
 *   will be updated to indicate if metadata changed. In order to detect metadata
 *   changes on a stream, you need to loop through all streams in the AVFormatContext
 *   and check their individual event_flags.
 *
 * -  Demuxers attempt to export metadata in a generic format, however tags
 *    with no generic equivalents are left as they are stored in the container.
 *    Follows a list of generic tag names:
 *
 @verbatim
 album        -- name of the set this work belongs to
 album_artist -- main creator of the set/album, if different from artist.
                 e.g. "Various Artists" for compilation albums.

                 separating them with commas.
 performer    -- artist who performed the work, if different from artist.
                 E.g for "Also sprach Zarathustra", artist would be "Richard
                 Strauss" and performer "London Philharmonic Orchestra".
