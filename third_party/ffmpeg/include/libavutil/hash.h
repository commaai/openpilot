/**
 * @defgroup lavu_hash Hash Functions
 * @ingroup lavu_crypto
 * Hash functions useful in multimedia.
 *
 * Hash functions are widely used in multimedia, from error checking and
 * concealment to internal regression testing. libavutil has efficient
 * implementations of a variety of hash functions that may be useful for
 * FFmpeg and other multimedia applications.
 *
 * @{
 *
 * @defgroup lavu_hash_generic Generic Hashing API
 * An abstraction layer for all hash functions supported by libavutil.
 *
 * If your application needs to support a wide range of different hash
 * functions, then the Generic Hashing API is for you. It provides a generic,
 * reusable API for @ref lavu_hash "all hash functions" implemented in libavutil.
 * If you just need to use one particular hash function, use the @ref lavu_hash
 * "individual hash" directly.
 *
 * @section Sample Code
 *
 * A basic template for using the Generic Hashing API follows:
 *
 * @code
 * struct AVHashContext *ctx = NULL;
 * const char *hash_name = NULL;
 * uint8_t *output_buf = NULL;
 *
 * // Select from a string returned by av_hash_names()
 * hash_name = ...;
 *
 * // Allocate a hash context
 * ret = av_hash_alloc(&ctx, hash_name);
 * if (ret < 0)
 *     return ret;
 *
 * // Initialize the hash context
 * av_hash_init(ctx);
 *
 * // Update the hash context with data
 * while (data_left) {
 *     av_hash_update(ctx, data, size);
 * }
 *
 * // Now we have no more data, so it is time to finalize the hash and get the
 * // output. But we need to first allocate an output buffer. Note that you can
 * // use any memory allocation function, including malloc(), not just
 * // av_malloc().
 * output_buf = av_malloc(av_hash_get_size(ctx));
 * if (!output_buf)
 *     return AVERROR(ENOMEM);
 *
 * // Finalize the hash context.
 * // You can use any of the av_hash_final*() functions provided, for other
 * // output formats. If you do so, be sure to adjust the memory allocation
 * // above. See the function documentation below for the exact amount of extra
 * // memory needed.
 * av_hash_final(ctx, output_buffer);
 *
 * // Free the context
 * av_hash_freep(&ctx);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section Hash Function-Specific Information
 * If the CRC32 hash is selected, the #AV_CRC_32_IEEE polynomial will be
 * used.
 *
 * If the Murmur3 hash is selected, the default seed will be used. See @ref
 * lavu_murmur3_seedinfo "Murmur3" for more information.
 *
 * @{
