/**
 * @defgroup lavu_murmur3 Murmur3
 * @ingroup lavu_hash
 * MurmurHash3 hash function implementation.
 *
 * MurmurHash3 is a non-cryptographic hash function, of which three
 * incompatible versions were created by its inventor Austin Appleby:
 *
 * - 32-bit output
 * - 128-bit output for 32-bit platforms
 * - 128-bit output for 64-bit platforms
 *
 * FFmpeg only implements the last variant: 128-bit output designed for 64-bit
 * platforms. Even though the hash function was designed for 64-bit platforms,
 * the function in reality works on 32-bit systems too, only with reduced
 * performance.
 *
 * @anchor lavu_murmur3_seedinfo
 * By design, MurmurHash3 requires a seed to operate. In response to this,
 * libavutil provides two functions for hash initiation, one that requires a
 * seed (av_murmur3_init_seeded()) and one that uses a fixed arbitrary integer
 * as the seed, and therefore does not (av_murmur3_init()).
 *
 * To make hashes comparable, you should provide the same seed for all calls to
 * this hash function -- if you are supplying one yourself, that is.
 *
