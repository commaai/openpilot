/* This is the numeric version of the libcurl version number, meant for easier
   parsing and comparions by programs. The LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM define will
   always follow this syntax:

         0xXXYYZZ

   Where XX, YY and ZZ are the main version, release and patch numbers in
   hexadecimal (using 8 bits each). All three numbers are always represented
   using two digits.  1.2 would appear as "0x010200" while version 9.11.7
   appears as "0x090b07".

   This 6-digit (24 bits) hexadecimal number does not show pre-release number,
   and it is always a greater number in a more recent release. It makes
   comparisons with greater than and less than work.

   Note: This define is the full hex number and _does not_ use the
   CURL_VERSION_BITS() macro since curl's own configure script greps for it
   and needs it to contain the full number.
