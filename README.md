Stand Back Labs openpilot vehicle extensions
------

This is a custom fork based on Comma.ai's openpilot project.
Goals:
* Remain fully compatible with Comma.ai hardware and infrastructure
* Keep repository in-step with latest Comma.ai master branches through automation (i.e. bleeding edge)
* (TODO: also coordinate with comma.ai release packages - tricky due to hotfixing)
* Follow Comma.ai's rules as closely as possible
* Maintain customizations such that Comma.ai _could_ upstream (even though they likely will not)
* Serve as a repository for disenfranchised vehicle ports, which can be used by other fork maintainers

Added vehicles
------
This provides basic support for most GM vehicles with a front facing camera and the Lane-keep assist feature.
Note: if your vehicle has radar-based adaptive cruise, only use this port if you are having steering faults.
Additionally, this fixes support for any GM vehicles with the so-called "picky" steering column (such as the Bolt EV)
Models with some success: Bolt EV, Equinox, Escalade, Acadia Denali, Malibu, Tahoe, Volt

What is openpilot?
------

[openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of [supported car makes, models and model years](docs/CARS.md). In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration and limitations here](docs/INTEGRATION.md).

Running in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things
* This software. It's free and available right here.
* One of [the 140+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md). We support Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, and more. If your car is not supported, but has adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist, it's likely able to run openpilot.
* A supported device to run this software. This can be a [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/two), [comma three](https://comma.ai/shop/products/three), or if you like to experiment, a [Ubuntu computer with webcams](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/webcam).
* A way to connect to your car. With a comma two or three, you need only a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness). With an EON Gold or PC, you also need a [black panda](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda).

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup).

Running on PC
------

All of openpilot's services can run as normal on a PC, even without special hardware or a car. To develop or experiment with openpilot you can run openpilot on recorded or simulated data.

With openpilot's tools you can plot logs, replay drives and watch the full-res camera streams. See [the tools README](tools/README.md) for more information.

You can also run openpilot in simulation [with the CARLA simulator](tools/sim/README.md). This allows openpilot to drive around a virtual car on your Ubuntu machine. The whole setup should only take a few minutes, but does require a decent GPU.


Community and Contributing
------

openpilot is developed by [comma](https://comma.ai/) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged. Check out [the contributing docs](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://blog.comma.ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot/) and [Model](https://blog.comma.ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models/) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://connect.comma.ai/). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using openpilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://comma.ai/privacy). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of comma. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to comma for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* openpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.
