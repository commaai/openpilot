        Before creating a **bug report**, please check the following:
          * Ensure you're running the latest openpilot release.
          * Ensure there isn't an existing issue for your bug. If there is, leave a comment on the existing issue.
          * Ensure you're running stock openpilot. We cannot look into bug reports from forks.

        If you're unsure whether you've hit a bug, check out the #installation-help channel in the [community Discord server](https://discord.comma.ai).
