our goal is to rewrite the pandad daemon in python from C++
* there is an existing panda python library at panda/
* we want to maintain 1:1 functionality and performance
* panda is specialized hardware that this PC does not have, but we have full CI coverage around it.
* on the PC, you can run the linter as you work to verify changes
