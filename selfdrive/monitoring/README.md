# driver monitoring (DM)

Uploading driver-facing camera footage is opt-in, but it is encouraged to opt-in to improve the DM model. You can always change your preference using the "Record and Upload Driver Camera" toggle.

## Troubleshooting

Before creating a bug report, go through these troubleshooting steps.

* Ensure the driver-facing camera has a good view of the driver in normal driving positions.
 * This can be checked in Settings -> Device -> Preview Driver Camera (when car is off).
* If the camera can't see the driver, the device should be re-mounted.

## Bug report

In order for us to look into DM bug reports, we'll need the driver-facing camera footage. If you don't normally have this enabled, simply enable the toggle for a single drive. Also ensure the "Upload Raw Logs" toggle is enabled before going for a drive.
