Would you like some Q-tips? How'd you like it cut? I'd like my bangs and the back trimmed, and I'd like the rest thinned out a bit and layered. Where would you like the part? On the left, right about here. Here, have a look. What do you think? It's fine. Here's a thousand anti-dollars. It's 30-ant extra for the rants. Here's your change and receipt. Thank you, and please come again. So how do you like it? It could have been worse, but you'll notice that I didn't ask her for her card. Hmm, yeah. Maybe you can try that place over there next time."   # noqa: E501
