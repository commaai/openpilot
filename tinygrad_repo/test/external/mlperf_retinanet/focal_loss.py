    Original implementation from https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore/blob/master/fvcore/nn/focal_loss.py .
    Loss used in RetinaNet for dense detection: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002.

    Args:
        inputs: A float tensor of arbitrary shape.
                The predictions for each example.
        targets: A float tensor with the same shape as inputs. Stores the binary
                classification label for each element in inputs
                (0 for the negative class and 1 for the positive class).
        alpha: (optional) Weighting factor in range (0,1) to balance
                positive vs negative examples or -1 for ignore. Default = 0.25
        gamma: Exponent of the modulating factor (1 - p_t) to
               balance easy vs hard examples.
        reduction: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'
                 'none': No reduction will be applied to the output.
                 'mean': The output will be averaged.
                 'sum': The output will be summed.
    Returns:
        Loss tensor with the reduction option applied.
