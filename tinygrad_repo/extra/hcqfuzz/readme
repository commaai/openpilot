# Fuzzing Infra

To add a new test, define a `TestSpec`-based class in a file in the `tests/` folder.

You can choose which tests to load from which file:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. RUN_FILES="hcq,allocator" python3 extra/hcqfuzz/fuzzer.py
```
Or skip tests from any file:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. SKIP_FILES="allocator" python3 extra/hcqfuzz/fuzzer.py
```
