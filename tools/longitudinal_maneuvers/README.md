# Longitudinal Maneuvers Testing Tool

Test your vehicle's longitudinal control tuning with this tool. The tool will test the vehicle's ability to follow a few longitudinal maneuvers and includes a tool to generate a report from the route.

## Instructions

1. Check out a development branch such as `master` on your comma device.
2. Locate either a large empty parking lot or road devoid of any car or foot traffic. Flat, straight road is preferred. The full maneuver suite can take 1 mile or more if left running, however it is recommended to disengage openpilot between maneuvers and turn around if there is not enough space.
3. Turn off the vehicle and set this parameter which will signal to openpilot to start the longitudinal maneuver daemon:

   ```sh
   echo -n 1 > /data/params/d/LongitudinalManeuverMode
   ```

4. Turn your vehicle back on. You will see the "Longitudinal Maneuver Mode" alert:

5. Ensure the road ahead is clear, as openpilot will not brake for any obstructions in this mode. Once you are ready, press "Set" on your steering wheel to start the tests. The tests will run for about 4 minutes. If you need to pause the tests, press "Cancel" on your steering wheel. You can resume the tests by pressing "Resume" on your steering wheel.

6. When the testing is complete, you'll see an alert that says "Maneuvers Finished." Complete the route by pulling over and turning off the vehicle.

7. Visit https://connect.comma.ai and locate the route(s). They will stand out with lots of orange intervals in their timeline. Ensure "All logs" show as "uploaded."

8. Gather the route ID and then run the report generator. The file will be exported to the same directory:

    ```sh
    $ python tools/longitudinal_maneuvers/generate_report.py 57048cfce01d9625/0000010e--5b26bc3be7 'pcm accel compensation'

    processing report for LEXUS_ES_TSS2
    plotting maneuver: start from stop, runs: 4
    plotting maneuver: creep: alternate between +1m/s^2 and -1m/s^2, runs: 2
    plotting maneuver: gas step response: +1m/s^2 from 20mph, runs: 2
